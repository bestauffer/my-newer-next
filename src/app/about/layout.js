        description: "Throughout this project, I collaborated with envko and the product owner to help determine envkos needs and delegate tasks among the team. I served as the scrum master to ensure the team adhered to project timelines.\n My primary contribution included implementing several enhancements on the sponsors' application that made it more efficient and intuitive. Specifically, I added functionality, such as a Face-ID login, and optimized the codebase to improve its overall performance. Additionally, I resolved pre-existing security issues and incorporated a kg/lb toggle option, CSS updates, and new user content. These updates were instrumental in improving the application's user experience and consequently helped in leading to its successful release on the Apple App Store.",
